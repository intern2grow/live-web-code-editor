# live-web-code-editor

Problem:

I have been tasked with implementing an auto-save functionality for a text editor application that uses localStorage to save the code written by the user. The goal is to ensure that any changes I make to the code are automatically saved to my browser storage without any intervention. Additionally, the saved code should be loaded automatically when I revisit or refresh the page, allowing me to pick up where I left off.


Solution:


To implement the auto-save functionality with localStorage, I  followed these steps:
1-I will create a text editor component in my web application where users can write their code.

2-I will define a function to save the user's code to the browser's localStorage. I can use the localStorage.setItem() method to save the code as a string, using a unique identifier to identify the code.
